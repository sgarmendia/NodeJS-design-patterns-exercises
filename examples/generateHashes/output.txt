What is wrong with the initial code was the setEncoding() function was called on a hash stream instance which is not correct. Also, the initial code was trying to re-use the inputStream which is already consumed/piped. That is why the corrected code creates a new stream instance for md5Hash. I've also incorporated use of async/await with promisify to handle the asynchronous nature of streams.
